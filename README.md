# D7S Arduino Library

This library improve the use of the D7S sensor developed by Omron.

## Getting Started

Just download the lastest realease and place it your Arduino IDE library folder. See [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)

### Installing

The D7S sensor must be connected to the I2C bus.

On most Arduino boards, SDA (data line) is on analog input pin 4, and SCL (clock line) is on analog input pin 5. On the Arduino Mega, SDA is digital pin 20 and SCL is 21. (See [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire)
